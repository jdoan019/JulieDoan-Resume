        <p class="lead mb-4"><br>Hello, my name is Julie Doan and I am a freshman at the University of California, Riverside. I am currently working towards a Bachelor of Science in Microbiology in order to apply for an accelerated nursing program after graduation. Before entering college, I attended Helix Charter High School where I was able to have the opportunity to do many extracurricular activities and meet new friends in a very diverse community. I was involved in yearbook, athletics, and various clubs. Throughout high school, I also had the chance to compete in multiple pageants to spread the message of how powerful and inspiring Asian girls and women are and using the platform to let other people know about my culture of being Vietnamese. I wanted to go to UC Riverside because of the numerous research and opportunities that were offered, additionally, it was a place where I can learn how to grow and become independent. Even though the institution was far from home, I was able to meet so many great individuals around different areas of California and gain more insight into the innumerable cultures. 
<br>

        The open field of science has fascinated me throughout high school. I learned about the beginning of life and how life is gradually changing and improving because of new studies and technological advances. The eye-opening and applicable knowledge science have given me have made me appreciate and value even the most basic functions of life. This subject gave me a better understanding of why certain crisis occurs in our society as well as our own family. I am enlightened by the innumerable topics science has to offer. The most interesting courses I have taken are anatomy & physiology and psychology. As a result of my growing interests, I decided to take courses such as child-development and public health to further my knowledge on the different aspects of science. Though each topic exemplified a different type of science, I realized that each course was interconnected with one another. I loved the challenges that came from these subjects. They have inspired and motivated me to major in sciences and begin the journey to becoming an assistant in the medical field. Understanding the human body's structures and their functions captivate me because that knowledge can help others. I strive to work in pediatrics because helping children, the minds of our future, is such a rewarding experience. Subsequently, I began volunteering at Alvarado Hospital and was able to learn more and grow on my communication skills, responsibilities, and commitment. Not only did I expand on my experiences, but I made connections and absorbed more information about the hospital system. From helping visitors to specimen runs to discharges, every time I entered the building, I loved what I did. Even when I made mistakes, I felt accomplished because I was able to make a difference. Because of science, I can envision myself having the opportunity to educate and aid people so there will be a healthy and safe community for all to live in.
